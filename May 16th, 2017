did some codingbat to see how im doing, it's soooo much easier than java
mastered the exponent by making functions
i have attained the power of importing
universal imports are convenient and all, but it's too extra
learned math stuff like sqrt, min, max, abs and etc.
almost done with functions, about 30 done with all the lessons.
will continue more codecademy tomorrow
